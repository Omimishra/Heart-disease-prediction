## Model (summary) ⚙️
This section summarizes the modeling work done in the project.
- Approach
  - Goal: Predict presence/absence of heart disease using clinical and diagnostic features.
  - Typical pipeline: data cleaning → feature engineering → feature scaling/encoding → model training → model evaluation

- Features
  - Uses clinical features present in the dataset (age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, max heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression, slope of ST, number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy, thalassemia, etc.).
  - All features were scaled when required by the model.

- Model Used
  - Sequential

- Evaluation metrics
  - Common metrics used: accuracy, precision, recall, f1 score and confusion matrices.
  - 86.81 accuracy

- Tech Stack
  - Python, pandas, numpy
  - Seaborn, matplotlib
  - Tensorflow,kears,scikit learn
